1. Reverse a Linked List 
key take away here is just keeping track of pointers...i had to create 3 separate pointers/trackers
2. Merge 2 Sorted Lists
key takeaway here is just keeping track of pointers...i had to 
3. Reorder List
You are given the head of a singly linked-list.
The positions of a linked list of length = 7 for example, can intially be represented as:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Reorder the nodes of the linked list to be in the following order:[0, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
Notice that in the general case for a list of length = n the nodes are reordered to be in the following order:
[0, n-1, 1, n-2, 2, n-3, ...]
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, but instead you must reorder the nodes themselves.
